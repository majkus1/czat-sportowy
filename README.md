czatsportowy.pl is a real-time communication app that allows users to join public and private chats during sports events. It was built using Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, with real-time communication handled by the socket.io library. Currently, the app supports a football category, where pre-match and live events are automatically fetched from the API-Football.

Additionally, each football chat includes an automatic match analysis generated by AI, using statistics provided by API-Football. This feature was implemented through integration with the OpenAI API. The app was deployed on a server and configured with Nginx to ensure high performance and reliable operation. The project is under continuous development and is regularly updated with new features.
